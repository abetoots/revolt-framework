Revolt Framework
===

Hi. I'm a custom plugin called `Revolt Framework`, the backbone for the job board functionality. I only work when paired with the theme `Revolt Jobs` to handle the front-end display. See it all in action at [flerson.com](https://flerson.com)

## Implementation:
+ ðŸ“Œ A **React App** for the employer's dashboard
+ ðŸ“Œ Includes `Advanced Custom Fields` as a third-party library
+ ðŸ“Œ Expose ACF fields to WP Rest API
+ ðŸ“Œ A custom login/registration flow
+ ðŸ“Œ A **reusable** Elementor widget that queries job posts in a specific date range.See [flerson.com](https://flerson.com)

See **frontend/react-dashboard/** to inspect the react app.
